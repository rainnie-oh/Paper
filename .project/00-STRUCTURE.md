# File Organization Rules

## Development Workflow
1. Read 01-CONTENT.md (source material)
2. Read 02-ASSETS.md (asset requirements)
3. Update code in src/
4. Place assets in assets/ with clear naming
5. Update PROGRESS.md after each phase

## Naming Conventions
- HTML: semantic section names
- CSS: BEM methodology
- Images: `section-name_element-name.ext`
- Videos: `section-name_demo.mp4`

## Asset Management
- Original assets → assets/
- Optimized for web → src/ references
- Always provide alt text and fallbacks
