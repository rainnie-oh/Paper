## Section 1: User Pain Points & Insights

**Phase 1: Authoring**  →  **Phase 2: Delivery**  

Engineers constantly jump between tools—MATLAB for analysis, Overleaf for writing, manually copy-pasting results  |  When engineering papers can't be run, verified, or interacted with, they become black boxes  

**Paper's Solution:**  

Unified environment where **writing = analysis = presentation**. What's delivered isn't a static report, but an explorable, reproducible interactive document.

## Section 2: Module-Product foundation

**Challenge + Workshop**

To define the product scope and clarify core requirements, I organized a workshop with the team using physical cards to simulate real user workflows.

**Core Insights**

**1. Users need to reference data from multiple sources**

Engineers pull data from different places—models from ODE+ simulation apps, code, external table files—and combine them into analysis workflows.

**2. Modules need clear roles and relationships**

Different modules serve different purposes (Code executes, Chart/Table visualizes, Text displays) and can form relationships.

**Design decision**

A modular system where Code, Text, Table, Plot can be assembled like building blocks, with parent-child binding for traceability and automatic updates.

## Section 3: Interaction & Component Design

**General Module Capabilities**  

All modules share unified behaviors: drag to reposition, resize, slash-command insertion.  

Parent-child relationships:Modules bind to data sources for data traceability and automatic updates.

**Code Module**  

Dual-view switching (code ⇄ diagram) + upstream data binding capability.

**Visualization Modules**  

Table and Plot can switch views within the same module while preserving data source.

## Section 4: AI + Module-based

**Paper's Opportunity**  

With modular structure and parent-child relationships in place, AI can understand complete workflows.This enables AI to accelerate analysis.  

Definition for Paper AI: **AI shouldn't be a general chatbot** but a **collaborator embedded in the workflow**.

**Design Principles**

1. **Context-aware**: AI understands module types, data sources, and relationships
2. **Workflow-embedded**: Triggered at natural friction points—error states, empty modules, result exploration
3. **Transparent**: Shows data sources and reasoning for every generation

**Core Mechanisms**

**Mechanism 1: Module-specific AI commands**  

Code modules: generate, fix errors, refactor. Table/Plot modules: analyze data, create visualizations, natural language Q&A. AI provides relevant commands based on module type.

**Mechanism 2: Dual entry points**  

Quick Add: Generate new modules based on existing results. In-module invoke: Refine current module content. Both show preview before acceptance.

**Mechanism 3: Transparent provenance**  

Every AI-generated output displays its data source and reasoning path—building trust and enabling verification.

## Section 5: Impact & Future Directions

**Impact**  

Launched public beta December 2025. Since then, we've welcomed ODE Believers from institutions including German Aerospace Center, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Technical University of Munich, and LTX Simulation GmbH.

**Next Step**  

Viewer-side AI: enabling readers to ask questions and explore results interactively.

**Closing Statement**  

The goal isn't smarter AI—it's clearer workflows where human insight and machine speed work in tandem.
