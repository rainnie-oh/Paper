## 作品集大纲：# Paper – Interactive Analysis Notebook for Engineers

### Hero Section
**Title:** Paper – Interactive Analysis Notebook for Engineers
**One-liner:** An AI-powered modular notebook that unifies engineers' fragmented workflow—bringing documentation and analysis into one environment
**Key Info:**
- Sole product designer | Led full 0-1 process
- Post-launch: paid conversion + recognized by German Aerospace Center and Technical University of Munich

### Section 1: User Pain Points & Insights
**User Scenario:**
Engineers writing technical reports constantly switch between tools—one for coding and running analysis, another for writing documents, manually copy-pasting results, and finally exporting static files.

**Typical Breakpoints:**
- **Overleaf**: LaTeX is not WYSIWYG, formatting requires repeated compilation, inefficient writing
- **MATLAB**: Models and results must be exported elsewhere to share, no collaboration support

**Core Insight:**
The problem isn't lacking better tools—it's that **existing tools separate the thinking process from the final output**. Documents only show conclusions, analysis workflows can't be reproduced, and clients want to explore "what if I change this parameter" but can only view static PDFs.

**Paper's Positioning:**
Enable **writing = analysis = presentation** in one environment. What's delivered isn't a static report, but an explorable, reproducible interactive document.

### Section 2: Defining Product Form
**Title:** From Abstract Concept to Composable System
**Challenge:** Founder's requirement was "a computational document editor"—too vague.
**My Approach:** Made the system tangible with physical cards. Through iterating different scenarios, we discovered:
**Core Insights:**
- **Dual-mode need**: Canvas mode for building data flows AND document mode for linear writing.
- **Component I/O relationships**: Determines how modules connect.
- **Publishing flexibility**: Engineers vs. Clients (different views).

### Section 3: Interaction Design
**Title:** Building Blocks, Precision Fit
**Details:**
- Composable system: code, data visualization, or text.
- Unified drag, resize, and connect behaviors.
- **Code Modules**: Dual-view switching (code ⇄ diagram).
- **Visualization Modules**: Table and Plot switching.
- **Parent-Child Linking**: Visual connection lines show data flow.

### Section 4: Embedding AI in Workflow
**Title:** From Insights to Design Decisions
**Design Principles:**
1. Context-aware
2. Workflow-embedded
3. Transparent & Iterative
**Core Mechanisms:**
1. Intelligent Suggestions (by module type)
2. Complete AI Workflow (trigger -> preview -> accept)
3. Follow-up Iteration (context persistence)

### Section 5: Impact & Future Directions
**Impact:** TUM plans coursework adoption; Modelica Association & DLR interest.
**Reflection:** Moving from Editor AI to Viewer-side AI.
