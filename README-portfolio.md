# Portfolio Project

Modular portfolio framework for "Orthogonal".

## Structure Overview
- `.project/`: Planning and content source files.
- `src/`: Source code (HTML, CSS, JS).
- `assets/`: Media assets organized by section.
- `docs/`: Technical documentation.

## Getting Started
1. Check `.project/PROGRESS.md` for current status.
2. Review `.project/01-CONTENT.md` for the latest content.
3. Assets should be placed in `assets/` and optimized versions referenced in `src/`.

## Development
- Run a local server in the `src/` directory.
- Follow BEM methodology for CSS.
